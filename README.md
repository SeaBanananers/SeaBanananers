- Hello, Iâ€™m @SeaBanananers
- You shouldn't be here.
- Why are you lurking?
- Don't you have better things to do?
- You really don't have better things to do?
- Maybe go find a hobby?
- Join your local fire department?
- Move out of your parent's basement and lead an actual life?
- Come on, why are you still reading?
- Can't you catch the drift?
- Just leave.
- Close this website.
- Go do something else.
- Literally, I said stop.
- Why can't you just leave?
- You see that big X and the top right of your screen?
- Click it.
- Do it now.
- Go touch grass.
- Do literally anything other than read this.
- This is literally pointless.
- How much more time are you going to waste reading a random's README?
- I'm literally running out of things to type.
- So just leave already.
- No?
- What's it going to take?
- How about this.
- You leave.
- Go touch grass.
- Be a good ant in the ant colony.
- Then I'll give you nothing.
- Sounds good?
- Good.
